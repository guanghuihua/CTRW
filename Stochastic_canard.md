# Canard Phenomenon under Stochastic Forcing
Background: Deterministic Canard Explosion

Canard trajectories are characteristic solutions in slow–fast dynamical systems that closely follow an unstable slow manifold for an extended period before rapidly departing (a “duck” trajectory). In the canonical two-dimensional system (a scaled FitzHugh–Nagumo model):

$$\dot{x} = \frac{x + y - x^3/3}{\delta}, \dot{y} = a - x~, $$ 
a small change in the parameter $a$ can produce a *canard explosion*: an abrupt transition from small-amplitude oscillations to large relaxation oscillations:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. This occurs in a very narrow $a$-interval when $\delta \ll 1$. The deterministic canard cycle is “supersensitive” – a tiny $a$-variation causes a jump in oscillation amplitude:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

**Question:** *Do canard cycles and explosions persist under additive Gaussian white noise, and how are the thresholds/behaviors altered?*

We summarize findings for three cases: noise added to (1) the slow equation only, (2) the fast equation only, and (3) both equations. Both rigorous analyses and numerical studies over the past few decades (roughly 1980s–2020s) indicate that canard phenomena *do* persist in a stochastic sense, but the transitions become probabilistic rather than deterministic. Even weak noise can qualitatively alter the canard dynamics:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. Key effects include *early or delayed canard transitions, “split” oscillation amplitudes, shifted bifurcation thresholds,* and noise-induced mixed-mode oscillations or chaos. Table 1 (below) compares representative models, noise types, and outcomes. 

## Noise on the Slow Variable (e.g. $dy/dt = a - x + \sigma\xi(t)$)

Adding white noise to the slow equation (the $y$-equation) means the slow variable wanders stochastically, effectively jittering the parameters that the fast subsystem “sees.” This **stochastic perturbation of the slow drift** tends to *smear out* the sharp deterministic threshold for a canard explosion. In other words, instead of a single critical $a$ where the trajectory “jumps” to a large cycle, there is a window of $a$ (whose width grows with noise intensity) where the system **randomly switches** between small- and large-amplitude oscillations. Even *below* the deterministic explosion value, noise can induce occasional large oscillations by pushing the trajectory off the stable slow manifold (a form of *stochastic excitability*). For example, Bashkirtseva & Ryashko (2018) showed that environmental noise in a predator–prey model with a canard regime caused **noise-induced oscillations below the Hopf/canard threshold and shifted the effective bifurcation point**:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. Freidlin’s earlier work (2001) had also noted that small noise can *create* stable oscillations (limit cycles) in systems that are near a bifurcation:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. Thus, under slow-variable noise, **canard trajectories still occur but in a probabilistic sense**: one observes occasional canard-like excursions (large spikes) even in parameter regimes where deterministic dynamics would stay small. 

As the noise intensity increases, the “canard explosion” becomes increasingly blurred – large-amplitude oscillations emerge at lower $a$ and with a stochastic timing. This manifests as **mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs)**: a random sequence of small and large oscillation segments in the time series, instead of a single-size limit cycle:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. From a geometric perspective, noise in $y$ perturbs the slow passage through the critical manifold’s fold. Sometimes the slow variable fluctuates in a way that triggers an *early jump* off the unstable branch; other times, it may hover slightly longer than expected. On average, however, *early jumps dominate*: Sowers (2008) rigorously proved that a random perturbation can “select” between a full canard cycle (the “duck with head”) and an aborted small cycle (“headless duck”) with a probability depending on noise amplitude:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. In effect, **noise in the slow equation lowers the effective canard-explosion threshold** by inducing premature departures from the canard trajectory. The result is often a **bistable distribution of oscillation amplitudes** in the canard regime: e.g. some sample paths follow the small cycle while others realize the large cycle. This phenomenon has been observed numerically as *noise-induced splitting of canard cycles*:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. In a recent stochastic calcium oscillation model, for instance, weak noise in the slow recovery variable led to a mix of small oscillations and large spikes within the canard zone (a form of random MMOs):contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Such *splitting* is characterized by a **bi-modal distribution of oscillation amplitude and period**:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. It signals that the deterministic canard explosion, instead of a clean jump, becomes a *probabilistic phase transition*: noise causes trajectories to hop unpredictably between the “pre-” and “post-” explosion states. Despite this randomness, the **essence of the canard persists** under slow noise: trajectories still trace close to the repelling slow manifold for a time (albeit with wobble) and then eventually jump to the relaxation phase. The canard “threshold” can be defined statistically (e.g. the $a$ at which there’s a 50% chance to jump by a given time). Studies using *stochastic sensitivity analysis* and confidence ellipsoids (for example, in chemical reactor models) indeed find a well-defined “most noise-sensitive” canard cycle that marks where randomness most likely triggers the jump:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. In summary, additive noise in $dy/dt$ **preserves canard-like oscillations but turns the sharp explosion into a smeared, stochastic transition**. The small-amplitude portion of the cycle becomes fragile – it may be shortened or skipped on any given realization – and the *effective* bifurcation point shifts to lower parameter values as noise intensifies:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.

## Noise on the Fast Variable (e.g. $dx/dt = (f(x,y))/\delta + \sigma \xi(t)$)

 Noise added to the fast $x$-equation has an even more immediate impact on canard dynamics. The fast variable governs the quick jump (excursion) phase of the oscillation. **Additive white noise in $x$ can knock the trajectory off the slow manifold abruptly**, even when the deterministic system would still be in the small-amplitude regime. Berglund, Gentz & Kuehn (2012) gave a rigorous description of this: they found a *high probability of early exit* from the canard trajectory due to random kicks:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. In fact, they proved that even **small noise will almost surely cause the solution to leave the unstable slow manifold *sooner* than it would deterministically**:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. The consequence is that the classic canard “duck” is cut short by noise: the trajectory typically *does not* follow the unstable branch as far, jumping off earlier. This aligns with physical intuition – a slight random perturbation in the fast variable can tip the delicate balance maintaining the canard. Once $x$ deviates beyond the vicinity of the unstable manifold, the flow rapidly carries it to the relaxation phase. One direct effect is that the **canard’s small-amplitude segment becomes hard to observe** under sufficient fast-variable noise. There exists a *critical noise intensity beyond which the small oscillation portion is effectively obliterated by fluctuations*:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. In practice, the time-series will look dominated by large swings with noise, without the clear plateau of small oscillations that a deterministic canard cycle would have. Berglund *et al.* quantified this threshold: above a certain $\sigma_c$, the amplitude of stochastic fluctuations exceeds the size of the would-be small limit cycle, so the “duck’s head” is lost in the noise:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. However, **the large-amplitude relaxation part of the cycle tends to survive**, since once the trajectory jumps, it follows the stable slow manifold down as a relaxation oscillation (which is robust). Thus, one observes noisy relaxation oscillations interspersed with erratic small excursions (if any). Importantly, the *parameter range* for which mixed small/large oscillations occur is altered. **Fast noise effectively widens the canard explosion parameter zone**, because even before the deterministic canard point, noise may induce sporadic large excursions. At the same time, it blurs the distinction between the pre- and post-explosion attractors. Stochastic sample paths may randomly jump to the large cycle and then back, causing a phenomenon sometimes described as *stochastic mixed-mode oscillations*. This was seen, for example, in a stochastically forced Van der Pol oscillator: even a weak fast perturbation generated irregular sequences of small and large oscillations where deterministically only small ones persist:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. In neuronal models (e.g. stochastic FitzHugh–Nagumo), noise in the fast voltage equation can similarly provoke *stochastic spikes* out of an excitable small oscillation regime. Wainrib (2011) identified such a mechanism as *self-induced stochastic resonance* – at an optimal noise level, the system flips in and out of a canard-like oscillation, whereas too large noise destroys the coherence:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Despite the disruptive nature of fast noise, canard-like **“jumps” still occur and the notion of a canard explosion persists statistically**. One still finds that as $a$ increases, there is a sudden qualitative change from quiescent (small fluctuations around a quasi-equilibrium) to sustained large oscillations, but under noise this change is gradual and random. For instance, in a *suspension flow* experiment with random forcing (noise in the fast rheological variable), researchers observed that *even tiny random disturbances can qualitatively change canard oscillations*, inducing an early transition to relaxation oscillations:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. They discovered the same noise-induced amplitude **splitting**: the stochastic limit cycle does not have a single amplitude, but splits into two meta-stable states (small vs. large):contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. The fast noise essentially **accelerates the canard explosion** – the system behaves as if it were closer to (or past) the bifurcation. In summary, **noise in $x$ tends to destabilize the canard’s slow passage**, leading to early exits (“premature ducks”) and broadening the range of mixed oscillatory behavior. Nevertheless, the large jump in amplitude associated with a canard explosion *does* remain evident, albeit as a noisy, probabilistic event rather than a deterministic bifurcation.

## Noise in Both Fast and Slow Variables

When both equations are driven by noise, these effects combine. In practical modeling, many authors include noise in all state variables to represent ubiquitous fluctuations. **Canard explosions remain observable under combined noise**, but the dynamics are highly complex. The slow-variable noise causes drift in the bifurcation parameter, and the fast-variable noise triggers instantaneous kicks – together producing *stochastic resonance-like scenarios* where noise can both induce and modulate oscillations. Touboul *et al.* (2015) studied a **large stochastic neural network** (Wilson–Cowan equations with adaptation) in which noise enters through the aggregate coupling (affecting both fast and slow population activities). Remarkably, they proved that **the *mean-field* deterministic limit of the network obeys a slow–fast ODE that exhibits a genuine canard explosion**, and that *noise is in fact responsible for creating this canard cycle* on the mean:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. In their system, **“noise induces canard explosions and Mixed-Mode Oscillations on the mean”** trajectory:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. Thus, with both fast and slow fluctuations present (infinitely many weakly coupled units each contributing randomness), one can *still* have a coherent canard phenomenon emerging in the averaged behavior. This is an example of a constructive role of noise – stochasticity *unlocked* a canard regime that the deterministic mean-field might not have had otherwise. They further showed that for **finite-size networks**, randomness causes *early jumps and random attractor switching*, analogous to what we described above:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. In systems like the stochastic **Luo–Rudy cardiac model** (3D with voltage and calcium dynamics), which effectively has noise in multiple variables, **weak noise was found to induce MMOs in a canard regime**:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. Slepukhina *et al.* (2022) identified a “super-sensitive” cycle in this model – essentially the stochastic canard point – at which trajectories begin to exhibit random large early afterdepolarizations (EADs) corresponding to canard-induced spikes:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}. They observed a *noise-driven transition to chaos* as well in the canard zone:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}, meaning the interplay of dual-source noise led to a complicated oscillatory pattern with positive Lyapunov exponent (randomness amplifying irregularity). Similarly, Bashkirtseva’s group reports that in various slow–fast systems (chemical reactors, climate models, etc.), adding noise to *both* equations produces *stochastic P-bifurcations* (phenomenological bifurcations) where the stationary density of the system changes shape as the parameter crosses the canard region:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. For example, one observes a unimodal distribution of oscillation amplitudes splitting into a bimodal distribution (reflecting coexisting small and large oscillation likelihoods):contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. They also report *stochastic D-bifurcations* (dynamic bifurcations) where the qualitative behavior (e.g. the onset of chaotic oscillations) appears in a narrow noise-parametric zone:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}. Overall, **with noise in both $x$ and $y$, canard trajectories persist but with even greater variability**. Practically, almost every trajectory is unique, yet statistical measures (like mean oscillation amplitude, or distribution of jump times) can be defined and show clear signatures of the underlying canard explosion. The *threshold parameter* for explosion becomes a fuzzy band: one might define a lower bound (where large oscillations first become probable) and an upper bound (where small oscillations are almost surely gone). Noise in both variables tends to **widen this band** more than either noise alone. Nonetheless, the fundamental phenomenon – a sudden growth in oscillation amplitude associated with the system’s timescale separation – *remains identifiable*. It is often detected via changes in probability density functions or Lyapunov exponents rather than a deterministic bifurcation diagram:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. In essence, the canard explosion under dual noise becomes a *noise-induced transition* rather than a sharp bifurcation.

## Comparative Summary and Recent Developments

Table 1 compares several studies of canard explosions under stochastic forcing, highlighting the model, noise placement, observed effects, and methods. As seen, a consistent picture emerges: **canard cycles are extremely noise-sensitive**:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}, yet *many aspects of canard behavior carry over to the stochastic realm* in modified form. Notably, **“headless” canards (premature jumps) occur with high probability under noise:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}**, and one often finds a *range* of oscillatory patterns (mixed-mode sequences) instead of a single stable cycle:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. The notion of a **canard explosion persists as a rapid increase in oscillation magnitude**, but it is no longer an abrupt, deterministic event at a precise parameter; it becomes a fuzzier, noise-driven phenomenon (sometimes called a *stochastic canard transition*). **Theoretical approaches** to these problems include *stochastic slow–fast analysis*, large-deviation theory for exit times, and the **stochastic sensitivity function (SSF) technique**. The SSF method, used by Bashkirtseva *et al.*, computes confidence domains around deterministic cycles to predict how noise perturbs them:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}. It successfully identified, for example, which segment of a canard cycle is most vulnerable to noise (typically the unstable slow segment). Rigorous results (Sowers 2008; Berglund & Gentz 2012) have mathematically confirmed that noise concentrated during the canard phase causes most trajectories to exit early:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. Recent formal analyses have extended to colored noise (finite correlation) and even random chaotic forcing, finding similar outcomes (noise shifts oscillation boundaries and can induce “canard resonance” at an optimal noise level):contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}. In terms of **reviews**, the literature on deterministic canards is well-summarized (e.g. in the *Scholarpedia* article by Wechselberger or the SIAM Review by Desroches *et al.* 2012), and the general theory of stochastic slow–fast systems is covered in books like Berglund & Gentz (2006):contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. However, *focused reviews on canard explosions under noise* are just emerging as this becomes an active research topic. A 2020 *Philosophical Transactions A* issue on multi-scale dynamics included discussion of noise effects on canards:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}, and a 2021 *Chaos* Focus Issue highlighted how “inevitably present random disturbances can significantly deform” canard-cycle dynamics:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}. Many of the recent papers cited (2021–2026) devote background sections to summarizing developments in stochastic canards:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}. In particular, Bashkirtseva and collaborators have published a string of studies (2018–2026) across different application domains, effectively acting as mini-reviews of stochastic canard phenomena in those contexts. For example, **Bashkirtseva & Ryashko (2026)** analyze calcium oscillation models and catalog noise-induced canard complications (e.g. intermittency, multistability):contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}:contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}. These works emphasize common themes: the **“constructive” role of noise** (noise can *induce* canard-like oscillations in excitable systems):contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}, and the **“destructive” role of noise** (noise can destabilize or split canard cycles):contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}:contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}. Both aspects are now better understood than 50 years ago, thanks to these analyses. Table 1 below summarizes representative findings. Overall, the consensus is that **canard explosions do persist under stochastic forcing**, but with modified signature: the abrupt amplitude jump becomes a *stochastic bifurcation* (with a probabilistic threshold), small oscillatory epochs may be either truncated or entirely subsumed by fluctuations, and new dynamical phenomena (like MMO patterns, coherence resonance, or chaos) can emerge in the canard regime due to noise. This nuanced understanding is crucial in applications (neuroscience, climate, chemistry), where one must account for noise – fortunately, the theory now provides tools to predict how the “French ducks” behave in a noisy environment:contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}.
